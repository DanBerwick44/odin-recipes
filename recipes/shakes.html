    <h1> Chocolate Banana Protein Shakes</h1>
    These protein shakes were made for gaining muscle during a bulk cycle, and use a generous amount of peanut butter to add
    calories (and protein). Those of you in a cut cycle have been warned!
    <h2> Ingredients </h2>
    <ul>
        <li> Oat milk (or your preference of dairy/dairy-alternative) </li>
        <li> Protein Powder </li>
        <li> Peanut-butter (I recommend against shelf-stable varieties for this recipe) </li>
        <li> One Banana </li>
        <li> Cacao Powder </li>
    </ul>
    <h2> Instructions </h2>
    <ol>
        <li> Add all ingredients into a blender. </li>
        <li> Blend thoroughly </li>
        <li> It's just a shake, what do you want from me? </li>
        <li> Drink it yo </li>
        
    </ol>
